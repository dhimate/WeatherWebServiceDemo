/*
	The events defined in this file act as an API between applications
	or blocks and service monitors.  They provide functionality to 
	Subscribe to status messages.
	
	The aim of this API is to provide an abstraction over any adapter
	specific details - for example, some adapters may require an explicit 
	call to subscribe to such data, some may be sent it anyway.
	
	Any adapter specific information that the application needs to supply
	or be supplied can be passed in the extraParams dictionary - these 
	are free-form (though there are conventions on the keys, see below).
	
	The service monitor also needs to handle any session initiation that
	may be required.
	
	A Status event does not denote a change of state, merely what the current
	state is - in particular, one will be sent out after every 
	SubscribeStatus request.

	All operations and responses are keyed on serviceId (if non-blank), 
	object,	connection and subServiceID. Every event starts with these 4 
	fields.

/**
 * This file contains the shared event definitions that are generic across 
 * all Scenarios.  
 *
 * WARNING: 
 *    The event definitions contained in this file form an internal protocol 
 *    and may change between software releases.
 *
 * Notes:
 * 1) The Event definitions contained in this file MUST be considered
 *    as an internal implementation of the communications protocol
 *    between the Apama client API and an Apama server.  As such
 *    these event definitions MUST NOT be considered "stable" and are 
 *    subject to change in any future software release.
 *
 *    The ONLY supported public APIs to the Scenario Service are the 
 *    Java client API (in the com.apama.services.scenario package) and the 
 *    .NET client API (in the Apama.Services.Scenario namespace).  
 *    Customers should not attempt to interface at the event or 
 *    EPL layer. Some events have been changed over time (as 
 *    noted here).
 *
 * 2) Most events now contain an initial field called "scenarioId". This string 
 *    uniquely identifies a scenario inside the correlator, and is used as 
 *    the package name, in several events, and for making up a part of the 
 *    data and control channel names.
 *
 * 3) Events that are intended to be used in a request-response pattern contain
 *    a "messageId" field.  The value of this field must be copied from the 
 *    request event into the response event. The mechanism allows clients to 
 *    match up request-response pairs.
